# dirty_cadmus

## What did I do here? 
1) Cloned cadmus changed the remote and pushed to an empty repository.
2) worked off a screenshot... 
3) checked out to strategic commit's ex: `git checkout 32f5c71`
4) created a new branch for appropriate branch name ex: `git checkout -b 1-problems`
5) git push ... it will prompt. Follow terminal directions.
6) repeat steps 1-5 for next significant commit.

7) after step 6 is complete. create a text file specifying the order you would like the branches to merge their history toward. (this is for poorman's automerge implementation)

## Why does this exist. 
1) this repository serves as the sekeleton for testing the effectiveness of git-automerge and poorman's-automerge implementations. 
2) for poorman the first test will be integration:
i) add commits to a few branches.
ii) run the poorman alias.
iii) pass or fail?
